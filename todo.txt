* About me section-
Interests-
- Weight Training:
I'm captivated by weight trainingâ€”it's more than just lifting; it's a journey of overcoming challenges. The rush, progress, and setting goals keep me fully engaged. It's not just about muscles; it's about discipline, patience, dedication, and building character. Coming from 13 years of ballet, I seamlessly transitioned into weight training at the age of 16, and it's been my passion ever since.

Aerobics, with stairs, running, and dancing, is my happy place. It's not just exercise; it's where I find clarity and a refreshing escape. The joy of movement and the relaxed feeling post-workout make it a vital part of my routine, recharging my energy and lifting my mood.

- Healthy Lifestyle:
Beyond workouts, I'm into healthy living. I love exploring nutritious recipes and understanding how our bodies work. It's not just a habit; it's a constant quest for knowledge. I'm into mindfulness, digging into brain intricacies, positive thinking, and strategies for a winning mindset. Always exploring and experimenting, I enjoy sharing the secrets of well-being.
